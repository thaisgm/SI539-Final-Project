            <p class="text">Ever feel like you're running low on music recommendations? Spending hours scrolling through Spotify and can't find new music to fit your mood? Or do you find new music but don't feel like you know enough about the genre to talk about it with friends?</p>
            <p class="text">This application allows you to explore new music through the Spotify API. Also, on the genres page, you can explore different genres and famous artists from each categories. Personally, my favorite genre of music is country from the 80s.</p>

            <p class="text">My name is Thais Gonzalez and my journey into the world of 
                technology began with my childhood passion for fantasy and science 
                fiction novels. I realized the closest I could get to the magic I 
                grew up reading was through the new technologies of our future!
            </p>
            <p class="text"> I graduated from the Ross School of Business, with 
                concentrations in product development and technology. My business 
                background really helped me gain critical communication and management 
                skills, as well as providing fuel to my entrepreneurial spirit. My 
                love for programming also bloomed, and I completed a software 
                engineering fellowship in San Francisco as well as computer science 
                coursework throughout my 4 years. Several internships and impactful 
                classes began pushing me towards a new passion: harnessing exciting 
                technologies to help promote equity and sustainability.
            </p>
            <p class="text">This new focus led me to pursue a MS in 
                Information at Michigan, concentrating in UX Research 
                and Design and Agile Development. I hope to apply user-centered 
                design thinking to complex problems in order to create intuitive
                and inclusive solutions.
